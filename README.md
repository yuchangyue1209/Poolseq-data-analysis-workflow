# Poolseq-data-analysis-workflow
Two typical pipelines for Poolseq data anlaysis. The first one performs variants calling directly via mapping. The second one includes independent genome assembly.
The first workflow is simple and fast. It suits for high-quality reads and board question regarding population genetics. It doesn't require large computational caculation which is opposite with the second workflow.
